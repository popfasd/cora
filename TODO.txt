1.0 Release

	* Deadline for stable build is October 2012
	
	FEATURES
		- #note-form student and tag fields need to allow auto-complete
		- swipe right to move back
		- swipe left to move forward
		- export notes
		- first-run capability
		- inform user if update is available (appcache, standalone apps only)
			- use a mode variable (cora.Config.mode) to determine what features should be enabled
	
	HOUSEKEEPING
		- all interface text needs to be abstracted to cora.Lang.[message]
		- console.log = function () {};
		- try and wrap db activity in transactions where possible (persistence.transaction())
		- onDelete events where the entity id returns null should provide an error dialog
			- currently, just silently transition to #home
		- copyright credit and license at top of all original files
			
	BUGS
		- confirm that screens are cleared during onBeforeShow
		- dialogs are a little flaky still, try having dialogs on separate pages
		- page history needs to be cleaned up, back buttons don't always work
		- after deleting note, #student still lists note
			- url is still #note?nid=[...]
		- consecutively added notes creates multiple copies
			- multiple calls occur to pagebeforeshow (two or more) in certain situations
			- part of jquery mobile navigation
			- may need to replace jquery.mobile.router.js as we need to have access to pagebeforechange()
